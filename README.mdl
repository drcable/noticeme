# A webapp to implement the SENPAI protocol in a user friendly way
[SENPAI](http://sigtbd.csail.mit.edu/pubs/veryconference-paper10.pdf) is a protocol that allows "efficient secure two-party computation on a problem of general interest with security against covert adversaries, while avoiding the overhead of zero-knowledge proofs. "
This implementation, as a webapp, allows a group of people to exchange mutual interest in a set of activities without the potential embarasment of communicating interest if the seccond party is not interested
